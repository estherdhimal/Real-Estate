      <div class="testimonial">
        <blockquote>
          "I moved to Toronto From Montreal and searched the internet for a real estate agent to help me buy a house.
           I spoke to more than 10 agents. One of the agents was Phil. I had a good feeling about him from the 
           very beginning. He is very humble and an easy going, and more importantly very informed 
           about different parts of GTA. I asked him so many questions and he answered all of them. 
           The Toronto Real Estate market is so different from Montreal and Phil made the transaction so simple and easy for me.
            I confidently, recommended him."
